name=Spectre Viewer
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=View spectra stored in a geodataset. The spectral data must be stored in an array, e.g. as an postgres array datafield or as a comma separated string. When features in the dataset are selected, the integrated spectra over these features will be displayed. Click in spectra to read out values. Use arrowkeys to move.
The energycalibration is presently hardcoded, look for the values acalib and bcalib. (Energy=acalib*channel + bcalib)
